                The iRODS Consortium brings together businesses, research organizations, universities, and government agencies to ensure the sustainability of iRODS by:<br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Guiding further development of the software;<br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Growing the user and developer communities; and<br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Facilitating iRODS support, education, and collaboration opportunities.<br/><br/>
                The Consortium maintains and supports a commercial-grade distribution of <a href="">iRODS</a><br/><br/>
                The iRODS Consortium fields a team of software developers, application engineers, and support staff housed at RENCI at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Each year, the Consortium hosts the iRODS User Group Meeting, a symposium that draws 100+ participants to Chapel Hill to share iRODS technologies and case studies.<br/><br/>
                <h3>iRODS Support</h3>
                The iRODS Consortium provides support through Consortium membership and on contract. Commercial support is available through the iRODS Partner Program. See the iRODS Support page for additional information.<br/><br/>
                <h3>iRODS Consortium Membership</h3>
