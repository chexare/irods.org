                    <h3>John Schnase<br/>Climate Informatics Lead</h3><br/>
                    <i><b>Office of Computational and Information Sciences and Technology, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</b></i>
                    <br/><br/>
                    John Schnase is a Senior Computer Scientist in NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Office of Computational and Information Sciences and Technology. He leads the Office’s climate informatics R&D activities, which focus on the development of new information technologies and their transfer into practical use. He also is a Principal Investigator on the Applied Sciences Program’s RECOVER Project, which is building cloud-based decision support capabilities for post-wildfire ecosystem recovery. John’s training and experience is in ecology and computer science. Before joining NASA in 1999, John’s work on the life history of Cassin’s Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii) resulted in an early application of computers in avian energetics modeling. As a co-organizer of the ACM Hypertext ’91 Conference, he assisted Tim Berners-Lee with the first public demonstration in the United States of communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http) client and server via the Internet. John attended Angelo State University, the University of Texas at Austin, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas A&M University, where he earned his PhD in Computer Science in 1992. He is a member of the External Advisory Board of NFS’s DataNet Federation Consortium, a member of the Executive Committee of the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and a former member of the Biodiversity and Ecosystems Panel of the President’s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).
