We aim to provide a RENCI-certified off-the-shelf binary solution that
works with the existing ecosystem of open source, pre-built software
packages. This initial release carries the beta designation because we
would like feedback from the community.

[The release, checksum information, and installation instructions can be
found on the download page.](http://e-irods.com/download)
