The iRODS team at RENCI welcomed two new members in May 2014: Ben Keller
and Dan Bedard.

Ben Keller is the sixth member of the software development team.
Previously, he developed control software for utility companies. He will
be expanding test coverage of and making further improvements to the
iRODS continuous integration (CI) environment. When asked why he decided
to join the team, Ben responded, “I believe distributed data networks
are where we are headed, and I think open source software like iRODS is
the best vehicle to take us there.”

Dan Bedard joins Leesa Brieger on the sales and marketing team, as a
market development manager. Dan will be working to identify and enroll
potential Consortium members and providing existing Consortium members
with sales support and iRODS demonstration tools. Dan is actually a
former RENCI employee, re-joining after two years in business
development at an RF amplifier company. “When I heard what RENCI and the
Consortium were doing with iRODS,” he said, “I knew right away that I
wanted to come back and get involved.”

Both Ben and Dan will be at the [iRODS User Group
Meeting](http://irods.org/2014/04/irods-user-group-meeting/ "iRODS User Group Meeting")
in Cambridge, MA held June 18-19. Please welcome them to the team when
you see them there.
