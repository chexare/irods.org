Status: published

On the heels of the Kerberos release a few minutes ago, we are also
releasing version 1.0 of the GSI iRODS authentication plugin this
morning.

Tested packages for Ubuntu 10 and 12 and CentOS 5 and 6 can be found at
<ftp://ftp.renci.org/pub/irods/plugins/irods_auth_plugin_gsi/1.0/>.

There are no SuSE packages at this time as the Globus toolkit is not
easily accessible for SuSE. If this is a burden, please let us know and
we can work harder to make it available.

Please confirm the checksums for the package(s) you download before
installing.

The code is open source and available, along with a README:

<https://github.com/irods/irods_auth_plugin_gsi>

As always, please contact <info@irods.org> if you have any questions.
