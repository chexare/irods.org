We at the iRODS Consortium are pleased to welcome Justin James and Cesar
Garde to our team.

Justin James is our new application engineer. He previously developed
and supported Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems, with extensive
programming and troubleshooting experience with a variety of
technologies. Justin will be providing deployment and operational
support to our Consortium members and professional services clients.
About iRODS, he says, "I'm excited to learn about this technology and to
help the diverse groups of people using it."

Cesar Garde is the Consortium's new user interface developer. Before
joining the team, Cesar was in charge of the Art and User Interface
Direction at the Harry Fox Agency, where he designed and helped develop
all of the client facing web interfaces. Now Cesar will be working
closely with the DICE group and other iRODS Consortium members to create
the next generation of graphical iRODS interfaces. “I can’t wait to help
expand the iRODS user base and shape how people will interact and
control their data in the future.”

Welcome aboard, Justin and Cesar!
