With the [release of iRODS 4.0.3 a few days
ago](http://irods.org/2014/08/irods-4-0-3-released/), the plugins need a
slight version bump so that they are compatible with the modified
low-level iRODS Error Object that is passed around throughout the
system.

Tested packages for Ubuntu 10 and 12, CentOS 5 and 6, and SuSE 11 and 12
can be found at the following locations:

-   <ftp://ftp.renci.org/pub/irods/plugins/irods_auth_plugin_gsi/1.1/>
-   <ftp://ftp.renci.org/pub/irods/plugins/irods_auth_plugin_krb/1.1/>
-   <ftp://ftp.renci.org/pub/irods/plugins/irods_microservice_plugins_curl/1.1/>
-   <ftp://ftp.renci.org/pub/irods/plugins/irods_resource_plugin_s3/1.2/>
-   <ftp://ftp.renci.org/pub/irods/plugins/irods_resource_plugin_wos/1.1/>

Please confirm the checksums for the package(s) you download before
