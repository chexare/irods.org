Status: published

The iRODS database plugins (currently PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle)
have been released and marked as v1.4. This is a minor update that
addresses a few Oracle-specific bugs and one data-loss bug affecting
metadata after an administrator runs \`irmtrash\`. This data-loss bug is
silent in that it could affect a random data object by deleting all of
its metadata due to an uninitialized objectID on the stack. This bug was
found with Valgrind.
