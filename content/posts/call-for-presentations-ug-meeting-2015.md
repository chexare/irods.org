**We (hope we) have ways of making you (give a) talk!**

I'm pleased to announce that the website for the iRODS User Group
Meeting 2015 is now up at
[ugm2015.irods.org](http://ugm2015.irods.org "iRODS User Group Meeting 2015").
Over the coming weeks, we will be filling in information about
registration, hotel accommodations, and program agenda.

One page that is already complete is the [abstract submission
page](http://irods.org/ugm2015/abstract-submission/ "Abstract Submission").  
<!--more-->  
We are seeking presentations on iRODS-related activities such as iRODS
applications in life sciences, geosciences, social science, and
information science, as well as the continued development of the iRODS
core and pluggable technologies.

We will have three presentation formats available: a poster session,
20-minute descriptive talks, and 40-minute demonstrations.

In order to help organize the agenda, we are requesting that presenters
submit abstracts describing their presentations topics **no later than
March 6th**.

By March 16th, the program committee will notify presenters whether
their talks have been accepted for presentation at the meeting.

We will also be compiling a User Group Meeting Proceedings, consisting
of papers written by presenters.

Full details on presentations and papers are available on the
[Presentation
Guidelines](http://irods.org/ugm2015/presentation-guidelines/) page of
the website.

Please comment on this post, or [contact
us](http://irods.org/ugm2015/contact/ "Contact") with any questions you
have about the meeting.

And most importantly, **Thank You**. The User Group Meeting is as much
produced *by* our user community as it is *for* our user community. I'm
truly looking forward to seeing you in Chapel Hill this June.
