DICE & iRODS Consortium Collaborative Agreement

￼Date: 05/31/2013

**Objective**

To ensure the long-term sustainability of iRODS as a community-driven,
open-source technology that continues past current US federal funding,
the DICE Center and the iRODS Consortium (formerly the E-iRODS
Consortium) are announcing the following partnership and roadmap for
future releases of iRODS.

**iRODS Today**

The iRODS software has been downloaded by groups in at least 39
countries and by 62 academic institutions within the US. iRODS now
manages collections that together include multiple millions of data
objects and many petabytes of storage. Adoption continues to increase in
academic, industry, and federal sectors and the application of iRODS in
different domains has continued to grow. iRODS is now a cornerstone
technology for NSF efforts to build a national data-sharing
infrastructure for research. Several groups, including the DICE research
team, are now looking at innovative ways to improve iRODS as a
best-of-breed data technology through new research and development.

Increased adoption in industry, academics, and federal settings requires
increased efforts devoted to maintenance and support. In addition, there
will be an increased need to integrate iRODS with other technologies, to
incorporate new technologies and methodologies, and to continue to
incorporate new research in policy-driven data management. The current
model of reliance on U.S. federal grants is recognized as insufficient
to respond to these needs.

**iRODS in Future**

Successful open-source software models provide reliable software to the
community while ensuring community contributions to the software are
encouraged and ensuring that the investments of users who have adopted
the technology are protected. In partnering, DICE and the iRODS
Consortium will continue to provide iRODS as open-source software and
will continue to support contributions from the community. Through this
partnership, iRODS adopters will be able to use the Consortium to ensure
the iRODS technology continues to be managed and supported, to ensure
access to support and consulting, and to ensure the software evolves to
meet their needs. The Consortium will be able to support the DICE team
in their continuing efforts to improve the iRODS technology through new
innovations and to apply the technology in sponsored applications.

**Roadmap and Release Plan and Strategy**

￼**iRODS 3.4**: targeted for late 2013. This release will combine
features and fixes from 3.3 iRODS and 3.0 E-iRODS. The iRODS Consortium,
in partnership with DICE, will be responsible for maintaining and
patching the 3.4 release, as well as for management of subsequent iRODS
releases.

**iRODS 3.5**: targeted for mid 2014. For 3.5, we aim to transition to a
fully pluggable architecture to facilitate the release of extensions
that can be developed and deployed independent of new iRODS
distributions. The DICE team will partner with the iRODS Consortium in
releasing extensions and patches for application to DICE-awarded grants.

All releases will remain open-source to facilitate community
contributions and support additional distributions. To facilitate this
direction, Dr. Reagan Moore and Dr. Arcot Rajasekar will serve as
Principal Scientists in the iRODS Consortium to provide technical and
scientific guidance. Antoine de Torcy of the DICE team has joined the
iRODS Consortium as a staff member to aid with development of the 3.4
and subsequent releases.

This means that the future integrated pluggable iRODS architecture will
serve the different community needs: with Consortium-supported
production versions (which contain bug fixes, new Consortium driven
features and community contributions of general importance), as well as
pluggable extensions, either through DICE supported features and bug
fixes for ongoing grants, or through community contributions ("as they
are") as in the past.

It is the recommendation of this partnership that production usage of
iRODS migrate to Consortium-supported distributions to ensure that
long-term support and responsiveness to production needs can be
provided.
