Given a user community who does not have root access to their machines,
the ability to distribute the iCommands and use them from within a
user's home directory would be desirable. Â We will discuss how to build,
bundle and configure the iCommands for use by a user on a linux platform
without root access.

### Building the iCommands

Starting from a clean irods repository, from within the top level
directory run the command:  
` dan_admin:~/irods$ ./packaging/build.sh -r icommands`  
The build script will download the external libraries, compile the
iRODS client library, and then compile the iCommands. EPM will be used
to package the iCommands into either a deb or rpm file. This we will
ignore and instead use a new script to build a tar file containing all
of the appropriate iCommand binaries and related client-side plugins.
From the top level of the iRODS repository, run:  
` dan_admin:~/irods$ ./packaging/make_icommands_for_distribution.sh`  
This short script will create an 'icommands' directory and copy the
iCommand binaries into it. It will create a plugins directory which will
include the basic authentication and networking plugins, then tar it up
for distribution to other users.

### Using the iCommands

Once the tar file has been expanded into a user's home directory the
user will need to set the PATH to the iCommands and then set up the
iRODS environment before authenticating against their Zone. Assuming the
iCommands now reside in the home directory of joe\_user, using a bash
shell as an example the user needs to amend their PATH environment
variable and verify that the iCommands are now in the path:  

` joe_user:~$ export PATH=/home/joe_user/icommands:$PATH joe_user:~$ which ils /home/joe_user/icommands/ils`  
Once the iCommands are successfully included in the user's PATH, the
iRODS client environment needs to be bootstrapped. The user should make
the iRODS environment directory and create an empty environment file:  

` joe_user:~$ mkdir .irods joe_user:~$ touch .irods/irods_environment.json`  
Once this is done, the irods\_environment.json file will need to be
pointed towards the location of the client-side plugins in order for the
'iinit' command to finish the bootstrapping process. Using their
favorite editor the user needs to add a few lines to
.irods/irods\_environment.json:  
` {  "irods_plugins_home" : "/home/joe_user/icommands/plugins/" }`  
After the location of the plugins is made available to the iCommands,
the user can run 'iinit' to finish setting up the iRODS client
environment:  

` joe_user:~$ iinit One or more fields in your iRODS environment file (irods_environment.json) are missing; please enter them. Enter the host name (DNS) of the server to connect to: joeserver.example.org Enter the port number: 1247 Enter your irods user name: joe Enter your irods zone: joeZone Those values will be added to your environment file (for use by other i-commands) if the login succeeds. Enter your current iRODS password:`  
At this point the user has a valid iRODS environment and can begin
using the iCommands.  
` joe_user:~$ ils /joeZone/home/joe:`  
Also, it is important to note that there are a number of additional
parameters available for
[modification](https://github.com/irods/irods_schema_configuration/blob/master/v2/service_account_environment.json)
based on the needs of the client as well as the iRODS server's
configuration.
