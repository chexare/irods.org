> </li>
> <li>
> First Class API Plugins - Enabling dynamic policy enforcement points
> (PEPs) and full parameter serialization for every plugin operation
>
> </li>
> <li>
> Refactored build system - CMake, Clang, APT/YUM repositories
>
> </li>
> -   CMake - Now a standard CMake project, much more developer friendly
> -   Clang - All supported platforms now building the C++14 codebase
> -   Packages separated - Cleaner dependencies, dev and runtime ready
>     for developers
> -   APT/YUM Repositories - Packages now hosted at RENCI, making
>     installations and upgrades much easier
>
> <li>
> All control scripts in Python - Reusable module, reduced codepaths
>
> </li>
> <li>
> New process model - Two long running processes to amortize dynamic
> linking startup cost
>
> </li>
> <li>
> Configuration schemas now included - Default setups will no longer
