If you've been following the
[blog](http://irods.org/post/irods-development-update-march-2015/ "iRODS Development Update: March 2015")
or
[iRODS-Chat](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/irod-chat/power8/irod-chat/bHcQWdkWu1I/eCkhP7CtWpoJ),
you have seen hints that iRODS is being compiled for POWER8. I'd like to
announce that [BioBuilds](http://biobuilds.org/) now hosts an
*engineering release* of iRODS for little-endian POWER8 systems at
<http://biobuilds.org/irods-for-ppc64le/>.

This work has been spearheaded by IBM engineers, with some support from
Consortium staff members. At risk of pre-empting the press release (it's
in the works!), we are excited about the work IBM and the community will
accomplish together under the auspices of the iRODS Consortium.
