The [Atmospheric Science Data Center
(ASDC)](https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/ "NASA ASDC") at NASA Langley
Research Center in Hampton, VA has signed an agreement to become the
newest member of the iRODS Consortium. The iRODS Consortium is a
membership organization of users and service providers that sustains the
integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) as free open source data
management software.

NASA’s ASDC processes, archives, and distributes Earth science data
pertaining to radiation budget, clouds, aerosols, and tropospheric
chemistry. The center was established in 1991 to support NASA’s Earth
Observing System (EOS) as part of NASA's Earth Science enterprise and
the U.S. Global Change Research Program. It is one of several
Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) sponsored by NASA as part of
the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). The
ASDC currently supports more than 44 projects and is home to more than
1,700 data sets.

"We archive and distribute massive amounts of data, products that are
vital to understanding atmospheric science, including phenomena such as
weather patterns, the impact of climate change, the distribution of
particles in the atmosphere, and air quality," said Brandi Quam, Deputy
Head of the ASDC. "iRODS is a tool that can help us manage that data
from ingest through long-term archiving and preservation. The future of
iRODS is important to us. As a member of the Consortium, not only do we
plan to contribute to its long-term sustainability, but we will also
have a voice in the development of new versions of iRODS, further
increasing its value to organizations with missions like ours."

The iRODS Consortium was formed in 2013 by RENCI (the Renaissance
Computing Institute) and the Data Intensive Cyber Environment (DICE)
research group, both research institutes of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. NASA Langley ASDC will become the seventh
member of the Consortium, which also includes [RENCI](http://renci.org),
[DICE,](http://dice.unc.edu/)[DataDirect Networks
(DDN),](http://www.ddn.com/)[EMC
Corporation,](http://www.emc.com/)[Seagate](http://http://www.seagate.com/),
and the UK-based [Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/).  
"The ASDC faces big data challenges that require a robust data
management solution, and iRODS is a perfect match for their needs," said
iRODS Consortium Executive Director Brand Fortner, PhD. "The ASDC will
provide valuable input to the iRODS development team that will help
iRODS meet the data management needs of the entire Earth sciences
research community. We enthusiastically welcome them to the Consortium
and look forward to many productive collaborations."

#### About the iRODS Consortium

The [iRODS Consortium](http://irods.org/consortium) is a membership
organization that supports the development of the Integrated
Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS), free open source software for data
discovery, workflow automation, secure collaboration, and data
virtualization. The iRODS Consortium provides a production-ready iRODS
distribution and iRODS training, professional integration services. The
world’s top researchers in life sciences, geosciences, and information
management use iRODS to control their data. Learn more at
[irods.org](http://irods.org).

The iRODS Consortium is administered by founding member RENCI, a
research institute for applications of advanced technologies at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For more on RENCI, see
